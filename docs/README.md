# SkyControl

SkyControl is a program which optimizes the use of the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to manage flights and 
passengers in an airport terminal for the present operation day.

SkyControl allows an Airport Operations Planning & Airside Manager to add, delete, update flight and passenger
information, add delays to flights
and list out both flight and passenger details by entering commands into the CLI.

We aim to provide ease of access to the manager, to access the relevant flight or passenger information
through a CLI which is faster than navigating through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
