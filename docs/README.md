![Home screen image](Ui.png)

Welcome to our humble project supervised by National University of Singapore's [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
This project is part of the requirement of an NUS module CS2113 where students are to develop
their own Command Line Interface based Java project. 

parKING is a lightweight CLI application that provides carpark lot availability to drivers in Singapore.
With access to a computer with Java 11 installed, you can view and add carparks to your favourite list
for easy access.
