### Add Property: `add -property`
Adds a new property into property list, along with Singapore address and unit-type validations. Also, duplicate property entries of the same **address** will not be accepted.

<u>Format</u>: `add -property n/NAME a/ADDRESS p/PRICE t/TYPE`


<u>Example</u>: `add -property n/Ash Ketchun a/25A Pallet Town, S121111 p/1600 t/LP BGL`

<u>Expected Output</u>:
```
Adding a property with the following information:
  Landlord: Ash Ketchun
  Address: 25A Pallet Town, S121111
  Renting Price: SGD1600/month
  Unit Type: LP Bungalow
```

The descriptions of `add -property` PARAMETERS are as follows:
- `NAME`: Name of property owner (Landlord)
- `ADDRESS`: Singapore Address (including postal code)
- `PRICE`: Rental Price per Month for property (SGD)
- `TYPE`: Type of property (e.g. HDB, Condominium, etc)

As there are validations involved, some PARAMETERS must adhere to specific formats as shown below:

For valid `ADDRESS`, a valid Singapore address must be provided with the following format and details:
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Format:
        [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME], S[POSTAL CODE]
        [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME] #[unit level]-[unit number], S[POSTAL CODE]
        [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME] #[unit level]-[unit number] [building name], S[POSTAL CODE]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Example:
        60 Aria Street, S602580
        101 Marlow Street #12-05, S059020
        101 Marlow Street #12-05 Clife Parkview, S059020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Note:
        1. Format requires single space between [DETAILS] (space sensitive).
        2. [DETAIL] must be provided; [detail] is optional.
        3. For landed property, treat [Block Number] as its unit number.
        4. Any deviation from format will lead to invalid address.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
For valid `TYPE`, one of the 15 valid Singapore-based unit type labels (App Pre-Defined) must be provided with the following format:
```
Format: t/<label>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HDB Labels:
  <HDB 2> for HDB 2-Room Flexi
  <HDB 3> for HDB 3-Room
  <HDB 4> for HDB 4-Room
  <HDB 5> for HDB 5-Room
  <HDB 3Gen> for HDB Third-Generation
  <HDB ExFlat> for HDB Executive Flat
  <HDB DBSS> for HDB Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) Flat
  <HDB ExMsn> for HDB Executive Maisonette
  <HDB Jumbo> for HDB Jumbo Flat
  <HDB TH> for HDB Terrace House
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Condominium Label:
  <Condo> for Condominium
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penthouse Label:
  <PH> for Penthouse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landed Property Labels
  <LP TH> for LP Terrace House
  <LP SDH> for LP Semi-Detached House
  <LP BGL> for LP Bungalow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Lastly, for valid `PRICE`, a positive integer must be provided.

There is also another validation which checks for mismatch between address format and unit type of property. Certain unit types will require specific address format. Please refer to the description below:
```
  1. Unit type with <LP> must not have #[unit level]-[unit number] in address.
     Format:
       [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME], S[POSTAL CODE]
  2. Unit type without <LP> must have #[unit level]-[unit number] in address.
     Format:
       [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME] #[unit level]-[unit number], S[POSTAL CODE]
       [BLOCK NUMBER] [STREET NAME] #[unit level]-[unit number] [building name], S[POSTAL CODE]
Note: HDB Terrace House (special case) is not restricted by any format.
```

**DISCLAIMER**:

Currently, there are some illogical inputs allowed by the application as shown below. Although validation can be done to prevent such cases, such validations will hinder normal operation and thus not implemented.
1. Properties with the same street name but of different address format (with / without unit level and number) are allowed to be added.
2. Properties with different street name but of the same postal code are also allowed to be added.

3 fields are required to be entered for successful operation:
- Command: In the context of this feature, the command will be `find`
- Client/Property: This section requires the selection of either client or property which is inputted after `-`.
- Query Text: After the tag `f/`, enter the text that will be searched through.

<u>Example:</u>

1. `find -property f/Bob The Builder`

```



---
### Exit: `quit`
Leaves the application with a goodbye message  
<u>Example:</u>  `quit`  
<u>Expected output:</u>  
```
Goodbye :). See you soon!
```

---
### Loading data
The loading of the data occurs during the start of the program, before any command is entered.
There will be 3 different loading operations:
- Client
- Property
- Pairing

Clients will be added to a list containing the clients if the data stored in `client.txt` conforms to the format. 
Before appending into the list, it will also be passed through a check to ensure each of the entity is in the right 
format. Should the data fail to be in the correct format, it won't be stored into list. 

Similar operation can be applied to the `property list` where the data is stored in `property.txt`. The entries will 
also be checked that it was stored in the right format and each of the entries conforms to the requirement before it's 
added into the list containing all the property.

The `pairing list` will be the last to load. This is done so to verify that the client and property is within the 
Client's list and Property's list respectively. In the scenario where either of the entries is not in, the **pair 
would not be loaded and will be considered as incorrect data inputted**.

---
### Saving data

Saving of data occurs in 3 instances of operation:

- Client is added to Client's List
- Property is added to Property's List
- Pair is added to Pairing's List

When client, property and pairing is added, text will be appended to the text file as shown below:

- `Client`: Appends `CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET` to `client.txt`.

An example of the client text file is as shown below:

![Client text file screenshot](./Storage%20File%20Screenshot/client.jpg)


- `Property`: Appends `LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE` to `property.txt`.

An example of the property text file is as shown below:

![Property text file screenshot](./Storage%20File%20Screenshot/property.jpg)

- `Pair`: Appends `[CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET] : [LANDLORD_NAME | 
PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE]` to `pair.txt`.

An example of the pairing text file is as shown below:

![Pairing text file screenshot](./Storage%20File%20Screenshot/pair.jpg)
---
### Updating data

Updating of data occurs in 6 instances of operation:

- Client is deleted from Client List - `delete -client` command invoked
- Property is deleted from Property List - `delete -property` command invoked
- Pair is removed from Pairing List - `unpair` command invoked
- Incorrect data identified when loading of Client from `client.txt`
- Incorrect data identified when loading of Property from `property.txt`
- Missing Client or Property when loading Pairs from `pair.txt`

When the updating operation occurs, it will iterate through the list, depending on which list has been updated.
While iterating through the list, the program will **convert each entry into the correct format** and **store in their 
respective text files.**

---
### Manual input of data

Since the data is stored in a text file, it **allows for user to manually key in the entries** and will be loaded
when the program is re-ran.

This is how the entries should be stored :

Client: `CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET`

Property: `LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS | PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE`

Pairing: `[CLIENT_NAME | CLIENT_CONTACT_NUMBER | CLIENT_EMAIL | CLIENT_BUDGET] : [LANDLORD_NAME | PROPERTY_ADDRESS |
PROPERTY_RENTAL_RATE | PROPERTY_UNIT_TYPE]`

Note that if the entries are stored incorrectly, the program will automatically remove the entries from the text file
during the next run of the program. This is done so to **prevent overcrowding** of junk data.
