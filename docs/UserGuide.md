## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: The data is stored in the /data folder of the computer where you ran the program, under the files `patient.txt`,
`prescription.txt`, and `visit.txt`. In order to transfer the data to another computer, move the /data folder to a
new directory on your new computer along with the OneDoc JAR file, and the JAR file in that directory.
