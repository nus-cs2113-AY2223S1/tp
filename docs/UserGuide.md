## Edit Command

Edit existing recipe with the given _INDEX_ as shown in the recipe list. To see the index of the recipe, you can use the `/list` command to
show all the recipe titles that is in your current recipe list. The _INDEX_ will be the number on the left of the recipe title.

‚Ñπ This feature allows you to choose between using GUI editor or CLI editor. For GUI editor, it will load the recipe information that was previously 
saved by the user. For CLI, you can make the relevant edits using the commands and flags as shown below.

### GUI Editor
The GUI Editor workflow is similar to [GUI Editor](#gui-editor)

Format: `/edit INDEX`

Example: 
```
/edit 1
```

### CLI Editor
The CLI Editor updates the recipe directly on the CLI. Users have to input the appropriate flags (recipe and command flags)
and take note of the format before entering the command.

Format: `/edit RECIPE_INDEX COMMAND_FLAG RECIPE_FLAG PARAMETERS`

**Recipe flags**: Specify the part of recipe that will be changed
- `-t`: *Title*
- `-d`: *Description*
- `-i`: *Ingredient*
- `-s`: *Step*

**Command flags**: Specify the type of function to be used**
- `-add`: *Adds a new ingredient or step*

    ‚Ñπ Only works for ingredient or step. Cannot add recipe title or description.

    - Parameter: `INGREDIENT or STEP`
    - Example:
      ```
      /edit 2 -add -i tomato/1/whole
      ```
      ```
      /edit 2 -add -s Cut the tomato into half.
      ```

- `-del`: *Deletes an ingredient or step*
  
  ‚Ñπ Only works for ingredient or step. Cannot delete recipe title or description.

    - Parameter: `INDEX`
    - Exactly **1 (one)** integer must be provided.
  - Example:
  ```
  /edit 2 -del -i 2
  ```
  ```
  /edit 2 -del -s 1
  ```
  
- `-swp`: *Swaps two ingredients or steps*
  - Parameter: `INDEX_1 INDEX_2`
    - Exactly **2 (two)** integers must be provided.
  - Example:
  ```
  /edit 1 -swp -i 1 2
  ```
  ```
  /edit 1 -swp -s 2 3
  ```

- `-chg`: *Changes the ingredient, step, title or description*
  - Parameter: `INDEX [INGREDIENT or STEP]` or `[TITLE or DESCRIPTION]`

    ‚Ñπ For title and description, type the changes right after the flags. No need for index.

    ‚Ñπ For ingredient and step, exactly **1 (one) index** must be provided before the changes.
        
      - Ingredient format: `INGREDIENT_NAME / AMOUNT / UNIT`
      - Step format: `STEP`
  - Examples: 
  ```
  /edit 2 -chg -t Salad
  ```
  ```
  /edit 2 -chg -d Lettuce salad with croutons and dressing
  ```
  ```
  /edit 3 -chg -i 2 Oyster sauce / 1.0 / tbsp
  ```
  ```
  /edit 3 -chg -s 2 Cut the lettuce into smaller pieces.
  ```

‚Ñπ The flag order (recipe and command flag) does not matter, but exactly 1 (one) command flag and 1 (one) recipe flag are allowed in 
an edit command.

‚Ñπ Not including the index, adding the wrong flags or using inappropriate parameters will throw an error.

‚Ñπ Trailing arguments and extra input before the last flag will be discarded.

The following two commands are identical to each other:
```
/edit 1 GARBAGE -i GARBAGE -swp 1 2 GARBAGE

/edit 1 -swp -i 1 2
```

# Data Management
<hr />

## Storage

The data files are stored at `./RecipeData` directory.

The template file and other miscellaneous files are stored at `./RecipeData/App` directory.

The individual recipe data files are stored at `./RecipeData/Recipes` directory.

There are 2 types of recipe data files to store recipes:
- **Overall File (OF)**: Keeps track of the recipe titles previously added to the recipe list. User can open this file to have a birds-eye-view
at all the recipes that is currently in the recipe list.
- **Individual Recipe File (IRF)**: The details of each recipe is saved as an individual file that is named
after the recipe title. User can open the individual recipe file to look at the full details of the recipe.

### Saving The Data
There is no need to save manually. Any updates made to the data will be automatically 
stored into the local drive and reloaded when _RecipEditor_ is restarted.

### Editing Data File

- After `/add`
    - New IRF (whose file name is named after the Recipe Title) is saved
    - New Recipe Title is appended to OF
- After `/edit INDEX`
    - Update existing IRF at INDEX
    - Update OF (change Title)
- After `/delete -t RECIPE_TITLE`
    - Delete existing IRF
    - Update OF by removing the Recipe Title of the recipe being deleted

### Parsing Data File

- If user tempered with the data files, these are the potential problems encountered when the program starts and reads
  the data
    - Mismatch between IRF Title and OF Title
        - Delete IRF
    - IRF content cannot be parsed
        - Delete IRF
- New OF File is generated from the model contains the valid recipes loaded from IRFs
