# User Guide for PlanIt

## Introduction

PlanIt is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based desktop application which will help NUS students to plan their modules and credits every semester. They can also check if they are eligible for NOC or SEP using this application.

Note that it is user's own responsibility to check and ensure that the module code that they entered is valid and fulfills any pre-requisites needed.


## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest JAR file from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your program.
4. Run in command prompt or double-click the file to start the app.
5. Type the commands in the command box and press Enter to execute it. E.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:
* Add a Module : `add m/MODULE_CODE s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER mc/NUMBER_OF_MCS g/GRADE`
* Delete a module : `delete m/MODULE_CODE`
* View modules in a semester : `view s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER`
* View all modules taken : `view all`
* Clears modules in a semesters : `clear s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER`
* Clears all modules taken : `clear all`
* Calculate MCs taken : `mcs s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER`
* Finds module information : `find <KEYWORD>`
* Checks for SEP/NOC program eligibility : `check <PROGRAM>`
* Overview of your Plan (MCs, CAP, Eligibility) : `overview`
* Exits the App : `exit`

## Features 

### Notes about format of input:
1. Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. 
2. YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER should be in the form YXSZ where X is the year number and Z is the semester number. For example, Year 2 Semester 1 will be Y2S1. 
3. MODULE_CODE must contain both Number and Alphabet. Also, must be less than 10 Characters.
4. GRADE can be either the letter grade  (eg. A+, A, A-), the S/U grade (eg. S, U) or Nil ("-") if the module has not been completed and has no grade yet. 
5. Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies m/MODULE_CODE s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER , s/YEAR_NUMBER_SEMESTER_NUMBER m/MODULE_CODE  is also acceptable. 
6. Every part of the command should be separated by a spacing " ".
