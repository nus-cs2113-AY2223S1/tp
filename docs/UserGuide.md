## 1. Introduction

Financial bookkeeping via traditional mobile applications has always been a hassle due to the repetitive clicks needed to manage monetary transactions. 
With Moolah Manager, you will be encouraged to take ownership of managing your finances via a time-saving and efficient command-line (CLI) interface.

The main features of Moolah Manager include:

- Managing records of monetary transactions
- Gathering financial insights such as categorical savings and periodic expenditure
- General budgeting and reminders about spending

The application is optimised for use with a keyboard and all you need is to just type in your commands into a terminal.
Moreover, if you are a fast-typist, the recording and querying of transactions can be performed efficiently.

General illustrations about the text format used for the commands in this guide can be found below. 

1. The **first word** in the command refers to the command word to be supplied by the user. The command words are case-insensitive. 
   1. e.g. `bye`, `BYE` and `bYe` will all be interpreted as the same.

2. Words in `UPPER CASE` refer to the parameters in each command. Each parameter must be prepended with a tag.
   1. e.g. in `delete e/ENTRY`, `delete` is the command word, while `ENTRY` is a parameter expected after the tag `e/`.

3. Parameters in square brackets are optional.
   1. e.g. `help [o/detailed]` can be used as `help o/detailed` or `help`.
   2. Note that the parameter `detailed` is written in lower case here, which means, only the exact wording is accepted.

4. Each parameter is separated by a space. Users are not allowed to use spaces in their parameter.

5. Each parameter can only be used at most once.

## 6. Others

### 6.1. Persistent Data

Our program comes with a storage feature to ensure user data gets saved each time Moolah Manager is stopped and restarted.
If you are accessing Moolah Manager via our JAR file release, the storage file, **duke.txt** would be newly created in a newly created **data** folder in your current directory.

In duke.txt, the monthly budget value would be stored on the 1st line, with the different transaction entries on subsequent lines.
When Moolah Manager is started, the program will attempt to store the budget and transaction values locally into the program.

If the duke.txt  data is in **incorrectly formatted** when Moolah Manager is started, none of the data would be stored into the program. 
An error message would be shown to inform users of the corrupted data and recommend editing the entries correctly. 
Suppose users want to continue with the program in the current state without updating the corrupted duke.txt data, 
they can enter any command which would add or alter the budget / transaction values which promptly **overwrites** the duke.txt data.

We **DO NOT** recommend editing duke.txt unless you are familiar with the storage syntax of the program to **prevent lose of data**.

### 6.2. Exiting the Application

**Format:** `bye`

**Expected Output:**

## 8. FAQ

**Q**: Why does running the command `java -jar duke.jar` in the command prompt or terminal not open up the application?
* **A**: It could be that you are not in the home directory of that application. Type `cd [PATH TO DIRECTORY CONTAINING .JAR FILE]`.

**Q**: How do I view commands while the app is running? 
* **A**: Type `help` command to view all the commands!

**Q**: Can I directly input values into the duke.txt file? 
* **A**: It is strongly advisable not to edit the duke.txt file as that could disrupt Moolah Manager's retrieval of the data.

**Q**: What should I do if most of my transactions are incorrect?
* **A**: You can consider using the edit or delete function to modify individual transactions at a time. However, if
 there are too many transactions to change, you can consider using the purge function to delete all values. 
 
**Q**: What is the purpose of using the different statistics commands?
* **A**: They provide you with great flexibility in viewing the current transactions from different perspectives. To analyze 
all the stored transactions, use `stats s/categorical_savings` or `stats s/monthly_expenditure`. Otherwise, use `stats s/time_insights`
to analyze transactions for a specified time period.
