## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Upcycle - a perfect desktop app dedicate to managing rental businesses. The nature of these businesses
requires dealing with tons of data; therefore, noting down all information with notes and pen is not ideal for managers.
It is developed for rental business managers, who can type fast to efficiently keep track of all of their customers, items,
and transactions via a Command Line Interface.

This UserGuide introduces you a brief overview of our features with examples of usage and expected outcome. Let's hop into section [2. Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to start using Upcycle quickly.

## 2. Quick Start

1. Install Java 11 on your computer.
2. Download the latest release of ```Upcycle.jar``` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W12-1/tp/releases).
3. Move the file to the desired folder for Upcycle.
4. Open the Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Unix) and redirect to home folder of Duke.
5. Launch the chatbot by using ```java -jar Upcycle.jar``` on Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal for Unix OS.

   You are supposed to see a greeting message like this if your setup is correct:
```

## 3. Features 

This section allows users to understand all the features that we offer, including the format, and the constraint. We also demonstrate some examples of usage and the expected outcome.

**PLEASE TAKE NOTE:**
>
>1. Upcycle commands (except ```find-item``` and ```find-user```) are case-sensitive and space-insensitive. For example, ```upcycle``` and ```Upcycle``` are different words, ```Upcycle``` and ```Upcycle ``` are the same words.
>2. Parameters can be shuffled. For example, ```update-item /i [ITEM_ID] /p [PRICE]``` and ```update-item /p [PRICE] /i [ITEM_ID]``` are the same.
>3. Phrases in ```[CAPITAL_WORDS]``` are the parameters for you to input.
>4. Argument value cannot contain ```/``` or ```|```.
>5. You must put a space between delimiter and value. For example, ```/nbuiducthanh``` is an error, but ```/n buiducthanh``` is correct
>6. Note that price inputs can only have at most 2 decimal places

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

>On your other computer, download your ```Upcycle.jar``` file following the instructions in [Quick Start](#2-quick-start). Then, you copy the `data` folder and paste into your folder for Upcycle on your new computer. That's it, now you can run our app with your previous data on another computer.

**Question:** If Duke crashes, is my data saved?

>Yes, Duke will automatically save your data to files after each operation. Therefore, data will be saved no matter how you exit the program, even with ```Ctrl-C```.

**Question:** What will happen if I modify incorrectly data in the files?

> Duke will detect if the data is modified incorrectly or not. If yes, it would give you a chance to try to fix the data in the files, but they would not able
> to use the app until Duke detect your data is fixed. If you cannot fix it, then you can choose to delete entire ```data``` folder. However, this also means that your previous data cannot be recovered.
> Please edit your data files at your own risk, otherwise, you might have to input all over again.
> 
> Note: 
> - Duke is designed not to be able to run with corrupted data file, not Duke crashes
> - You are allowed to manipulate data by editing the files, but you do it at your own risk. It can potentially cause unexpected behaviours afterwards and loss of data.
> - Example of expected error message when data is modified incorrectly:
> 
> ```
> ____________________________________________________________
> The TRANSACTION file has been corrupted at line 2
> Reason: The transaction is uncompleted but item cannot be found in the list
> ____________________________________________________________
> Please try to fix your data in your files before running the app again
> If you fix it correctly, you will see a greeting message in the next run
> If you cannot fix it, you will see this message again. Please delete the entire data folder
> to avoid errors, which also mean that all your data will be gone forever
> In that case, we will create three brand-new lists for your users, items, and transactions
> REMEMBER that all files in data folder must be edited correctly
> 
> Do you want to force reset all files and restart? Y or N
> ____________________________________________________________
>```

**Question:** How can I manually edit data files correctly?

> 
>**User file**
> 
> Each line represents one user with the format `[USERNAME] | [AGE] | [CONTACT]`
> 
> If you edit this files, please take note: 
> - Age range is from 10 to 100
> - If name is edited, please also edit all items of that user in the item files
> - Contact number length is 8
> - If user is removed, please also remove all items of that user in the item files
> 
> **Item file**
> 
> Each line represents one item with the format:
> 
> `[ITEMNAME] | [CATEGORY] | [PRICE] | [OWNER] | [ITEMID]`
> 
> If you edit this files, please take note: 
> 
> - Price range from 0 to 10000
> - Currently, we support 8 categories form 1 to 8
> - Item's name length is no more than 20 characters
> - Avoid change the name of owner, it can cause error (you can change both in user and item files)
> - No item ID occurs twice
> - If user is currently borrowing/lending something, do not delete him/her, or you can delete that unfinished transaction.
> 
> **Transaction file**
> 
> Each line represents one transaction with the format:
> 
> `[ITEMID] | [BORROWER] | [DURATION] | [CREATED_DATE] | [LENDER] | [ITEMNAME] | [MONEY_TRANSACTED] | [TRANSACTIONID]`
> 
> If you edit this files, please take note: 
> 
> - If the itemId occurs in item list, make sure the item's name and owner(lender) are matched with that item with given ID
> - Duration range is from 0 to 1461
> - Created date range is from 2016-01-01 to today
> - No transaction ID occurs twice
> - Money transacted valid range is from 0 to 15000000
> - If that transaction is UNFINISHED, make sure that the name of lender, borrower and item ID must occur in the list.
>
> You are allowed to change the username when all transactions related to them are finished and that username is unique.
> 
> You are allowed to change the item ID when all transactions related to them are finished and that ID is unique.
> 
> You are allowed to change the transaction ID if that new ID is unique.

**Question:** Why am I able to enter duplicates of the same item?
> Upcycle allows for duplicate items to be listed as transactions are made through each item's unique ID instead of the item's name.
