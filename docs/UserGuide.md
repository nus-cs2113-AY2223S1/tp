## Introduction

SkyControl is a program which optimizes the use of the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage flights and passengers in
an airport terminal for the present operation day.

SkyControl allows an Airport Operations Planning & Airside Manager to add, delete, update flight and passenger
information, add delays to flights
and list out both flight and passenger details by entering commands into the CLI.

It aims to provide an ease of access to the manager, to access the relevant flight or passenger information
through a CLI which is faster than a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Getting Started

1. Please ensure that you have **Java 11 or above** present in your computer
2. Proceed to download the latest version of `SkyControl.jar` from
   [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/releases).
3. Move the file to your desired folder that you have designated as the **main folder** for SkyControl.
4. Open a terminal and type java -jar SkyControl.jar (include the entire filepath for the jar file)
5. Once the program has been successfully initialised, you should see SkyControl greetings as seen below.

Example:

**Input**

`passenger add n/Ivan Theng fn/sq832 bg/01 sn/17d`

**Output**

````

<br>

**Q**: Why can't I input a passenger detail at the start of the program or during the run of the program?

**A**: A flight detail with a designated flight numbers has to be **recorded or exist** in the flight
list before a passenger flying with an airline of the same flight number can be added into the passenger logbook.

**Q**: Can I enter 2 flights with the same flight number in the input list?

**A**: No. SkyControl lists are only valid for 1 day and hence we prohibit duplicate flight numbers.

**Q**: Can I use SkyControl to save a flight/ passenger registered in a different airport terminal or on a different
day?

**A**: No SkyControl is currently limited to a single airport terminal and can only log flights/passengers within the
same day.
However, this can be a future implementation outside the CS2113 curriculum.  
  
**Q**: How is boarding time deduced?  
  
**A**: Boarding time for any airline would always be set to **45 minutes** before departure time.  
  
**Q**: Do I have to manually update the Boarding time for every passenger if I were to set a delay on a flight?  
  
**A**: Thankfully, you do not need too, SkyControl would automatically update the Boarding time for every
passenger if a delay in departure time is present.  
  
**Q**: Do I have to manually delete all the passengers of the same flight number that have been deleted in flightList?
  
**A**: Thankfully, you do not need to manually delete all passengers with the flight number that has been deleted,
SkyControl would automatically delete all relevant passengers that had their flight number deleted from flight list.
