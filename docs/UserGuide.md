# User Guide

## Introduction

TracknFit is a fitness tracking application for fitness enthusiasts. It allows users to track their
exercise routines, nutritional habits and biometrics, to help the user better understand and progress
towards their fitness journeys.

- FAQ
- Command summary

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `Duke` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W12-3/tp).

## Features

TracknFit offers 3 main components: **Biometrics, Exercises, and Food**  
For each component, you can **add, remove and view** records. Additionally, **find** command
is available for **Exercises and Food** components.

- Records are displayed in descending order of date by default

TracknFit can also summarise your caloric balance for each day.  
Please follow these guidelines when entering commands into the terminal:

- Words in curly brackets are parameters to be supplied, separated by backslashes `/`.  
  e.g. in `set biometrics /{age} /{gender} /{height} /{activity level}`, age, gender, height and activity level
  are parameters separated by `/` to be provided when using the `set biometrics` command.
    - **Parameters must be entered in the same order as described.**

- Parameters in square brackets `[]` are optional.  
  e.g. in `add strength /{name} /{weight} /{sets} /{reps} [/{date}]`, the `add strength` command can be used with or
  without a date parameter.
    - **If no date is entered for a new record, the current local date on your computer will be used.**
- All dates should be entered in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`. For example, `31-12-2020`.
- Parameters must not contain `/` within them. For example, `cheese/burger` is an invalid name for food

Records are automatically loaded when starting TracknFit, and saved when exiting TracknFit. Note that you must exit
TracknFit using the `exit` command (and not by closing the terminal) in order to save your changes.
