### Project: Timetabler
Timetabler is a desktop timetable planning application used by students of NUS to plan their NUS modules for either Semester 1 or 2. The user interacts with it using CLI. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature: Auto-Allocation of Lessons**
  * **What It Does:** Allows the user to automatically arrange all their lessons for their modules in a way that gives them the least
  amount of clashes possible.
  * **Justification:** With students taking up to 7 modules and each module having many possible classes, this feature is extremely useful for users
  and saves them a large amount of time trying to set lesson timings one by one or trying to figure out how to arrange their timetables to avoid clashes.
  * **Highlights:** This feature is one of the most useful features in our project as well as one of the more complex features. The allocation algorithm is able to calculate
    2.187 x 10^10 possible permutations of lessons.

* **New Feature: Original Data-saving Feature**
  * **What It Does:** Stores whatever data the user has set regarding their timetables in local data files.
  * **Justification:** Data-saving is a key feature of applications like ours. Users expect their data to be preserved across different runs
  and there should not be a need for the user to recreate their timetable everytime the program is run.
  * **Highlights:** This feature provides key functionality for our project. 
  * **Credits:** @cheehengk (https://github.com/cheehengk) for revising and improving the original code.
