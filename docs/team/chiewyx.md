## Overview

Upcycle is a perfect desktop app dedicate to managing rental businesses. The nature of these businesses
requires dealing with tons of data; therefore, noting down all information with notes and pen is not ideal for managers.
It is developed for rental business managers, who can type fast to efficiently keep track of all of their customers, items,
and transactions via a Command Line Interface.
