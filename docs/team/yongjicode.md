## Overview
Project: Pet Clinic Manager

### Summary of Contributions

New Feature:
- Added the ability to add/remove Tasks, and reassign Task from one employee to another

What it does: 
- After a Task is added into the overall TaskList, it is also added to the associated Appointment and Employee (to do the Task).
- Reassigning a Task will move the Task from one employee's Task List to another employee's Task List.

Justification: 
- This feature is the main value add to the manager / head nurse using this application - being able to add and assign task to employees, ensuring effective management and delegation of work within the clinic
- Taking into consideration that Tasks in a clinic can readily change hands, being able to reassign a task significantly improves functionality of the Task allocation feature

Highlights: 
- This enhancement was one of the most complex portions of this application as it required intricate interactions with almost every other feature (Appointment, Employee, Service, Pet)

Credits:
- Myself - for conceptualizing and building the connections with every other class
