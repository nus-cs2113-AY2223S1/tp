## Project: Moolah Manager

Moolah Manager is a financial bookkeeping application used for management of the monetary transactions.
The user is encouraged to take ownership of managing their finances via a time-saving and efficient command-line interface.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=chydarren&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: Added the list feature with filtering such as via transaction type, category and date.
    * What it does: Allows the users to list all transactions or filter them based on the filter tags specified.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to get an overview of the transactions that occurred in the past 
      and for them to track when they spent or earned.
    * Highlights: Listing transactions is used for many purposes such as to generate categorical savings and monthly 
     expenditure statistics.

* **New Feature**: Added the search feature for user to find specific transaction(s).
    * What it does: Allows the users to find specific transaction(s) by searching partial or full keywords that match
      parts of the description in each transaction object.
    * Justification: This feature complements with the listing as it is not possible to restrict users to
      the tag filters in the list feature to find their desired transaction(s). They may forget exact details of each transaction
      , so searching similar keywords would help. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement increases flexibility in the listing of transactions and provides convenience for users
      to quickly look up the transactions.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to retrieve transactions by the last N days, weeks or months.
    * What it does: Allows the users to list transactions that have occurred in the past by a specific date interval
      without having to specify the exact dates.
    * Justification: This feature improves the filtering of transactions that was previously restricted to a specific
      month, year, or date. The introduction of last N days enables users to get transactions that happened over the past 
      1 week (i.e. 7 days), which is not possible by querying the last 1 week.
    * Highlights: The transaction list generated by this feature is also used in Stats command to generate meaningful 
      insights into the users' expenditure over a specific time period.

* **Enhancements to Existing Features**:
    * Refactoring of UI functions from Command classes on the concept of separation of concern:
