#### Enhancements implemented -
* Added all the list features for the app -  
  PRM is an app with extensive options for listing the content stored in it -
  * Clients - Clients can be listed in various ways. All information present can be listed. A condensed version
    (called -short) lists the most pertinent information. Individual attributes of clients can also be listed.
  * Properties - Similar to clients.
  * Pairs - Allows listing information about all pairs present in the app. Pairs can be listed either with full
    information about their clients and properties, or with condensed information only. This was implemented as a
    response to a PE-D suggestion and had to be done quickly. Listed items here are not numbered as pairings are not numbered
    internally, and there was no time to change that before V2.1. Therefore, all members of the HashMap which stores
    the pairings are displayed, in no particular order.
* Added exceptions and messages related to the list function
* Contributed to the quit function - Added the message for quitting.
