## Project: Moolah Manager
Moolah Manager is a financial bookkeeping application used for management of the monetary transactions.
The user is encouraged to take ownership of managing their finances via a time-saving and efficient command-line
interface.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=paullowse&breakdown=true)

* **New Feature**: Added the stats feature
    * What it does: Allows the users to see important statistics of transactions filtered by categories or according to various time periods.
    Main features are total income, expenses and savings. 
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to get some important statistics of the transactions they selected from, to get a holistic
    understanding of their expenses and savings.
    * Highlights: Time insights is a combination of categorical savings and monthly expenditure for a specified period. This feature was done 
    with different implementations in mind, such as year, month, period and number tags, to give the user different ways to filter for their statistics.
    
 * **Enhancements to Existing Features**:
    * Refactoring of Command and Param classes into an OOP format
