## Project: Property Rental Manager
Property Rental Manager (PRM) is a desktop application that helps property agents manage, filter and monitor single
owner rental units for appropriate tenants. This application uses Command Line Interface (CLI) and is able to display
information quickly with minimal latency.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature:** Added the ability to remove Clients/Properties.
  - What it does: Deletes the Client/Property from the Client List/Property List respectively and deletes any pairings
    involving that Client/Property.
  - Justification: This feature allows the user to remove any clients and properties they are no longer managing.


- **New Feature:** Added the ability to check the information of Clients.
  - What it does: Search through the Hash Map and show the Client's information along with the paired Property if there
    are any.
  - Justification: This feature allows the user to view information on a Client and the Property they are currently
    renting (if any).
