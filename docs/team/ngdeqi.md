### Project: Property Rental Manager

Property Rental Manager (PRM) is a desktop application that helps property agents manage, filter and monitor single
owner rental units for appropriate tenants. This application uses Command Line Interface (CLI) and is able to display
information quickly with minimal latency.

Here are my contributions to the project:

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to pair properties with clients.
    * What it does: Allows the user to record the event where a client rents a property, by pairing them together.
    * Justification: This feature helps the user track which client(s) is/are renting which property.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unpair properties from clients.
  * What it does: Allows the user to record the event where a client is no longer renting a property, by unpairing them.
  * Justification: This feature helps the user track which client(s) is/are renting which property.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to check the information of properties.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view all information relating to a property, including the tenants who are renting it.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to easily pull up and view all information related to a specific property.
