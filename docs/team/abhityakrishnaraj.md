CurrencyManager - An easy wallet managing tool that helps you keep track of all your deposits

and withdrawals. With the possibility of keeping different currencies within a wallet and owning

multiple wallets, between which you can exchange and transfer funds.

Contributions: code

Ideas:

I was recommended that we choose this subject for your final project when we were coming up

with ideas that we could possibly make solutions for. While proposing the project and coming up

with features as a team I came up with most of the specific features that we eventually

implemented.

Features:

Login and Registration: Implemented the base implementation for logging in and registering a

new account, checking for the validity of usernames and passwords when first signing up for an

account or getting into an account

Implemented the Entire Currency Manager: I created all the methods and classes that implement

the currency manager and allow the user to access to any information about a specific currency

or find the conversion between multiple currencies, I also included the implementations to make

it customizable if accessed within an account

Built the Entire Help Center: I added all the functionality for giving the user the ability to change

their username, password, and default currency, or delete their account if they want to make any

changes with the administration of their account.

Command Tracking: I was able to keep track of the main commands that the user inputs while

working with money within their account and was able to use timestamped files to make a

unique implementation for temporarily keeping track of the commands that a user makes while

in their account. This could possibly be improved upon in the future to keep track of all entries

made over an accounts history but that might need more encryption.

Enhancements:

\1. Fixed most of the bugs that were discovered/ brought up after the PE-D





\2. The files we created to store most of the data weren’t updating properly with regards to

changes that were happening when the user was changing information within the account,

so I fixed a lot of the problems with the file names and the information within them

updating properly

Documentation:

• User Guide: Made the User Guide more readable, added the functions that I complete

along with their formats and examples of usage. I also formatted the table of contents and

added various commands that had been previously left out of the user guide

• Developer Guide: I added the acknowledgements, the currency manager and help UMLs,

instruction for manual testing, and other fixes throughout
