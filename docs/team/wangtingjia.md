## Product Overview
easySEP is a CLI application created to assist NUS Computer Engineering (CEG) undergraduates intending to embark on a Student Exchange Programme (SEP) in their planning for student exchange.
In particular, it is a useful utility for exploring potential module mappings for various partner universities,
creating and maintaining lists for them and also favouriting selected ones for easier reference. As an added feature, users can also curate their timetables to prevent potential clashes in lessons.

### Features

#### UserUniversityListManager, UserUniversityList Classes
* The main classes for users to store their university and a corresponding list of modules. Users are able to create lists, add modules, add comments and delete them respectively.
* **Notable PRs**: [#9](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/9), [#23](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/23)

#### UserModuleMappingList, UserModuleMapping Classes
* This is the main classes that UserUniversityListManager builds upon in OOP style. Each UserModuleMapping stores the information needed for a successful module mapping and UserModuleMappingList manages them.
* **Notable PRs**: [#9](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/9), [#23](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/23)

#### Favourite function
* Users are able to favourite some top picks for their SEP spots.
* **Notable PRs**: [#70](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/70)

#### Adding & Deleting of Comments function
* Users are able to add and delete comments in regard to a particular module he/she wants to map.
* **Notable PRs**: [#180](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/180), [#185](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/185)

#### PED Bugs
* Got rid of bugs found in the module's Practical Exam Dry Run (PED).
* Added a setup script to automatically download data and store in the right folder during execution under [#170](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/170).
* Successfully refactored TimetableManager into UserUniversityListManager class to enforce cardinality constraints and remove possible bugs under [#176](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/176).
* **Other Notable PRs**: [#178](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/178), [#191](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/191), [#192](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-W13-2/tp/pull/192)
