### Project: Timetabler

Timetabler is a desktop timetable planning application used by students of NUS to plan their NUS modules for either Semester 1 or 2. The user interacts with it using CLI. It is written in Java.




Given below are my contributions to the project
* **New Feature:** Added ability to search for information about a certain module.
    * What it does: allows the user to search for basic information about a specific module.
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to get a basic gist of what the module is about.
    * Highlights: This feature uses the NUSMods API, which is heavily utilised in the rest of the project.
    * Credits: [NUSMods API](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/) for all the information on modules in NUS.
      [FasterXML](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for parsing of json responses from the API.
