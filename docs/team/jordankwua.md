### Project: SkyControl
___
SkyControl - SkyControl is a program which optimizes the use of the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage flights 
and passengers in an airport terminal for the present operation day.

Here are my contributions to the project:
- ### New Feature : Added the ability to delete a flight from the list of flights
  + What it does: Allows the manager using the program to delete a flight's information from the flight list.
  + Justification: This feature is one of the fundamental features of the program which allows the manager to remove
  a flight detail that he/she may have entered wrongly or would like to remove from the flight list.
  + Highlights: The command uses the flight number of a flight's information to select and delete a particular flight.
This is possible due to the constraint that the team set which is that there will be no duplicate flight numbers within
the scope of this program.
- ### New Feature : Added the ability to save and read flight and passenger information that have been entered
  + What it does: Allows the manager using the program to enter flight and passenger information, store it in the hard
disk, such that when the program is shut down and re-opened the list of flights and passengers are stored and can still
be viewed.
  + Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a manager will not have to re-enter
all the information he/she wants to store in the program every time the program is shut down. This makes it more
convenient for the manager to use as he/she does not always have to leave their devices on.
  + Highlights: This feature combines both flight and passenger information into one single file for easy access.
It was tedious to make it such that the storage combined both flight and passenger information into one single data file.

- ### Enhancements to existing features:
  + Added more exceptions to make the code for flight information more defensive (Pull Requests [#21](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/21),
  [#97](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/97))
- ### Project Management:
  + Managed releases `v1.0`, `v2.0` and `v2.1` (3 [releases](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/releases)) on GitHub

- ### Contributions to UG:
  + Added the introduction for the UG, and the `Delete a flight detail` component under `SkyControl's Features`
    (Pull Request [#55](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/55))
- ### Contributions to DG:
  + Added the description for `Architecture` and the various components under `Architecture`, added the Architecture diagram
and various UML diagrams under these components (Pull Request [#97](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/97))
  + Added the `delete a flight` feature and relevant diagrams (Pull Request [#43](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/43))
  + Added the target user profile, value proposition and user stories under product scope (Pull Request [#97](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-1/tp/pull/97))
- ### Contributions to team-based tasks
  + Set up the GitHub team and repository
- ### Team contributions
