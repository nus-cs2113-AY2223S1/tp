### Enhancements implemented

#### addAppointment
What it does:
- Add an appointment to the list.
- It relates to a clinic service and a pet, with a valid date.

Justification:
- Will check every input params, i.e. `service`, `pet` and `date` before adding. This is to make sure it only relates to existing objects.

Highlights:
- This enhancement was the basis for further task management, as every task is created according to an existing appointment.
- It also interacts with class `service` and `pet` to provide user, i.e. the head nurse, with more detailed information on an appointment. 

#### removeAppointment
What it does:
- Remove an existing appointment from the list.

Justification:
- Since appointment is one of the *composition* of task, after removing one appointment leads all related tasks been removed automatically.

#### listAppointment
What it does:
- Show the detailed info of all appointments from the list.

#### findAppointment
What it does:
- Find the appointment with given id from the list.

Justification:
- It's not an API open for user, just serving as a helping function.

#### updateAppointmentStatus
What it does:
- Update the appointment status at specific time. 

Justification:
- Use status defined in `AppointmentStatus` class.
- When an appointment is first created, its status is `AppointmentStatus::PENDING`.
- When at least one of the tasks is derived from the appointment, while not all tasks are marked as done, it updates the status to `AppointmentStatus::PROCESSING`.
- When all tasks from the appointment are marked as done, it updates the status to `AppointmentStatus::PROCESSED`.

Highlights:
- This enhancement helps the appointment status to be updated without manually settings, as it is automatically called every time after executing `addTask` or finishing one `Task`.

#### checkFormattedDate
What it does:
- Check the given string before setting it as the `date` of one appointment.
- Given string must have format of `yyyy-MM-dd`.

Justification:
- When an appointment is first created, its status is `AppointmentStatus::PENDING`
- When at least one of the tasks is derived from the appointment, while not all tasks are marked as done, it updates the status to `AppointmentStatus::PROCESSING`
- When all tasks from the appointment are marked as done, it updates the status to `AppointmentStatus::PROCESSED`

Highlights:
- It uses the `SimpleDateFormat` from java library to check format and perform validation.
- It examines not only format, but also the logic, i.e. doesn't accept passed date, of the input date string.

**others**
- Added status of appointment as `AppointmentStauts` enum class
- Added exception handler to functions related to appointment
- Improved parser for removing appointment
- Fixed nearly half of the format errors in v1.0 checked by Gradle
