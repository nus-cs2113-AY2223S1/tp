### Project: PlanIt

PlanIt is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application to help School of Computing students to plan their modules and credits every semester.
They can also check if they are eligible for NOC or SEP using this application.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to Clear modules in the Student Plan
    * What it does: Allows the user to Clear modules for one Semester or all Semesters with one command
    * Justification: This feature enables users to simply remove modules in their Plan
    * Highlights: This enhancement is very useful for users when they want to restart or modify their Academic Plan
    * Credits: NIL

    * Justification: This feature is useful to have a quick glance of their Academic Plan
    * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging to implement as it requires implementations and modifications to other features such as `Check` and `View`.
    * Credits: NIL

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for users to view all format input issues for commands at once
    * What it does: Allows the user to view all input format issue(s) at once when using the `Add`, `Delete`, `View`, `Clear`, `MCs` and `View` command
    * Justification: This feature is useful for users if they made multiple errors when using a command, so they can rectify it accordingly
