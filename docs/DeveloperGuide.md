## Design

### Architecture

![](UmlDiagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-leve design of the App.

Given below is an overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

`Duke:`

* At Launching: Initialise the components in the correct sequence and connects them with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

`Ui:`

* Reading inputs from user and printing feedbacks to the user

`Logic:`

* The command executor

`Records:`

* Holds the data of the App in memory

`Storage:`

* Reads data and writes data to the hard disk.

`Exception:`

* Stores the exception classes for the app.

### Logic component

Here's a class diagram of the logic component.
![Logic.png](UmlDiagrams/Logic.png)

How the logic component works:

* After taking in the input from the user, it is parsed to the Parser class of the Logic component
  to interpret the user's command.
* This results in a Command object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses
  e.g., AddCommand), which would then be executed by Duke.
* The command can communicate with the Records when it is executed (e.g. adding a new food record or finding an
  exercise record).
* The command can also communicate with the Storage Component when it is executed (e.g. saving and loading records).
* Additionally, the command also communicates with Ui Component to display the results of the execution back to the
  user.
* The command is validated by the Validator class to handle user's input accurately and prevent bad commands from being
  executed.
* Finally, in case of command execution failures, Exception Object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses,
  e.g. Duke Exception) is thrown.

### Record component

![](UmlDiagrams/Records.png)

The record component,

* calls by logic components
* stores the exercise list data, all `Exercise` objects
* stores the food list data, all `Food` objects
* stores the biometrics data, in `Biometrics` object.
* stores wight and fat list data, all `WeightAndFat` objects.
* calculates calories for the calories object based on biometrics, exercise and food data to be store in the calories
  list

### Storage component

![](UmlDiagrams/Storage.png)
The storage component of TracknFit is responsible for loading data from the save file when the program starts,
and saves the data into the save file when the program stops. The Storage class uses the static methods in
DataLoader and DataSaver to load and save data respectively.   
Data is loaded by directing the text input into AddCommand and SetCommand classes as if they were user inputs.
If an error is encountered when loading, the line is printed to inform the user and logged at warning level. Remaining
data continues to load.  
Data is saved by calling the save methods for the different data types, which return Strings in the same format
as the user input.

**UI component**

The API of this component is specified in UI package.

![](UmlDiagrams/UI.png)

The UI consists of a TableFrame.
Parts such as FoodTable, ExerciseTable, CaloriesTable, AllRecordsTable inherit from the TableFrame class.

The UI component,

* executes user commands from the logic component.
* listens for changes to records data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the logic component, because the UI relies on the logic to execute commands.

## Implementation

### Add Feature

The add feature in TracknFit is split to 4 main components, food, strength, cardio and weight. After the object of the
respective class is created, it will be added to the respective list based on the add command input from the user.

We will use the sequence diagrams below to show how the add operation works.

#### Adding a new record

![](UmlDiagrams/Add.png)

The Duke will call execute() for the AddCommand object after the Parser class parsed the input is an add command. The
number of slashes in the input is determined by calling Parser.getArgumentsCount(argumentList) for input validation. The
execute() will then proceed to call Parser.getArgumentList to split the inputs into parameters. Parser.gtClassType()
will be called to obtain the type of addCommand. Specific type of add command will then
be called.

#### Adding weight and fat record

![](UmlDiagrams/AddWeightAndFat.png)

When the add command type is WeightAndFat, addWeightAndFat method will be called. If date is provided in the input,
parseDate method in Parser will be called, otherwise date is initialised to current date.
WeightAndFat object will then be created and added to the WeightAndFatList. If display is set to true, weightAndFat will
be converted to string, and prints with a success message to inform the user.

#### Adding food record

![](UmlDiagrams/AddFood.png)
AddFood method is being called to add food. After parameters from the user input is being parsed and verified, new Food
object is being created. Food is then added to the FoodList. If display is set to true, food is converted to string and
prints with a success message to inform the user.

#### Adding strength exercise

![](UmlDiagrams/AddStrengthExercise.png)

The addStrengthExercise method is being called to add strength exercise. First, validateAddStrengthExerciseCommand is
called by addStrengthExercise to validate the correctness of the input for add strength. Then,
executeAddStrengthExercise will be called to create a strength exercise, add to the exercise list, mark it done if it
being marked as done during loading. Then, the exercise is converted to string and display to the user, followed by the
success add message.

### Mark Feature

Marking exercise
The sequence diagrams below represent the interactions when a user marks an exercise record as done or undone.

![](UmlDiagrams/MarkExercise.png)

The Duke will call execute() for the FindCommand object after the Parser class parsed the input is a mark command.
First, to validate the accuracy of the input command, Parser.getArgumentsCount(arguments) is executed to obtain the
number of slashes. Then, The execute() will call Parser.getArgumentList to split the inputs into an array containing
parameters. Then, markExercise(argumentList, slashesCount) will be called to obtain the type of markCommand for
that correct type of mark command to be executed.

If the mark command type is of "done", the calories burnt via the exercise would be determined by executing
calculateExerciseCalories(biometrics, time, met). Then, the exercise at the given index would be mark done and
a corresponding message regarding the information of the exercise that is marked "done" will be printed via the Ui
Component.

If the mark command type is of "undone", then the exercise would be mark undone at the given index and a corresponding
message regarding the information of the exercise that is marked "undone" will be printed via the Ui Component.

### Find Feature

Finding a record

The sequence diagrams below represent the interactions when a user find a record.

![Find.png](UmlDiagrams/Find.png)

In the case that user removes a weight and fat record, the removeWeight method in removeCommand is executed.
As shown in the sequence diagram below, after the record is removed from the weightAndFatList, it is returned to
removeCommand to be printed on the ui.

![](UmlDiagrams/FindFood.png)  
In the case that user finds a food record, the findFood method in findCommand is executed, which will then execute
getFilteredFoodList(argumentList) to get arrayList of food records which contain the keyword that the user has parsed
in. If the filtered list is empty, a "Food not found" message is printed via the Ui Component. However, if the filtered
list is not empty, a table is created and filled with the data from the list. The table is then printed via the Ui
Component.

The interactions for finding other types of records are similar.

### View Feature

> > > > > > > master
> > > > > > > There is a choice to view food, exercise, weight, strength, cardio, bmi, maintenance, all.
> > > > > > > The Duke will call execute() for the ViewCommand object after the Parser class parsed the input is a view

Viewing historical records  
![View.png](UmlDiagrams/View.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works after `view biometrics` is executed.

The most recent weight and fat records are retrieved. Then, the most recently set biometrics of the user will be
displayed.

Viewing biometrics

![](UmlDiagrams/ViewBiometrics.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works after `view calories` is executed.

The calorie consumption, calorie burnt and net calories as well as a message with the corresponding date will be
displayed.
The calorie consumption is accumulated from the food list, the calorie burnt is accumulated from the
CompletedExerciseList and
the net calories can then be calculated from the two, according to a date.

These values are stored in a Calories object and output by a CaloriesList by calling ui.

Viewing calories

![ViewCalories.png](UmlDiagrams/ViewCalories.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works after `view all` is executed.

Food records are retrieved from FoodList, exercises are retrieved from ExerciseList and records are retrieved from
RecordList and these data are output by outputAllRecords.

Viewing all historical records sorted by date  
![ViewAll.png](UmlDiagrams/ViewAll.png)

### Removing records

The sequence diagrams below represent the interactions when a user removes a record.  
![](UmlDiagrams/Remove.png)  
In the case that user removes a weight and fat record, the removeWeight method in removeCommand is executed.
As shown in the sequence diagram below, after the record is removed from the weightAndFatList, it is returned to
removeCommand to be printed on the ui.  
![](UmlDiagrams/RemoveWeight.png)  
The interactions for removing other types of records are similar.

### Design considerations

**Saving data:**

* Option 1 (current implementation): Saves data only when user exits from TracknFit
    * Pros: Better efficiency for executing each command, easier to implement
    * Cons: If user exits TracknFit incorrectly or TracknFit crashes, all changes made in the session are lost
* Option 2: Saves the data to save file after every user command
    * Pros: All changes are saved even if TracknFit closes incorrectly or crashes
    * Cons: High overhead in executing each command, always O(N) time, where N is total number of records

## Product scope

### Target user profile

TracknFit is designed for fitness enthusiasts who are new or moderately experienced in fitness
and do not require specialised fitness advice

### Value proposition

TracknFit helps the user track their exercise routines, dietary habits and biometrics, allowing them
to better understand their journey and progress towards their fitness goals.
