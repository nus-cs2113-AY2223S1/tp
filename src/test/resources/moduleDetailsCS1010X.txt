Code         : CS1010X
Name         : Programming Methodology
Description  : This module introduces the fundamental concepts of problem
               solving by computing and programming using an imperative
               programming language. It is the first and foremost introductory
               course to computing and is equivalent to CS1010, CS1010S and
               CS1010E Programming Methodology. The module will be taught using
               the Python programming language and topics covered include
               problem solving by computing, writing pseudo-codes, basic problem
               formulation and problem solving, program development, coding,
               testing and debugging, fundamental programming constructs
               (variables, types, expressions, assignments, functions, control
               structures, etc.), fundamental data structures: arrays, strings
               and structures, simple file processing, and basic recursion.
