## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 11 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 11 in a previous Intellij project.
   * In the same dialog, you _may have to set the Project language level_ field to the SDK default option.
2. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
3. **Run the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()`. 

## Build automation using Gradle
