## Lost? Don't worry, we know where you need to go.

MoneyGoWhere is a financial tracking application to help you manage your finances.

Based on a Command Line Interface (CLI), you can add your `expenses`, `income` sources, spending `targets` and `recurring payments` to a trackable list that can be saved and accessed **anywhere, anytime**.

<br>

Although this application is mainly targeted at computing professionals who are familiar with CLI, **you don't have to worry if you're not an expert** -- MoneyGoWhere is **easy to pick up** and can help you start organising your finances in a matter of **moments**.
